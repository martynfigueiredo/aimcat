# 🐱 AimCat

AimCat is a simple, kid-friendly aim trainer built with Flutter and the Flame engine. Designed for both fun and skill-building, the goal is to **simply tap** like a cat paw to hit "good" targets while avoiding distractions.

## 🎮 About

AimCat focuses on a playful for everyone, but specially kids. The goal is simple: **simply tap** good targets (like hearts and stars) to score maximum points. This project was created as a loving homage to my children—the original "AimCats"—and serves as a primary showcase for my development portfolio.

## 🎯 Game Modes

- **Baby (30s)**: The gentlest mode. Only positive targets appear, they stay on screen longer, and every hit gives a bonus! Reduced scoring for pure tapping joy.
- **Toddler (30s)**: A step up. Bad items carry no penalty. Good items stay on screen 2x longer with balanced scoring. No clocks or complex combos.
- **Grandma (30s)**: Targets are 30% larger and stay on screen 2x longer for better visibility. No clocks or combos. Reduced scoring for a relaxed pace.
- **SpeedRun (10s)**: A quick blitz where targets appear 4x faster. Precision and speed are key!
- **Hacker (10s)**: The ultimate challenge. Targets appear 8x faster and disappear almost instantly (64x speed). Everything is worth 200 points, but you start with a -100 point penalty!
- **Marathon (90s)**: A standard test of endurance and focus.
- **Ultra Marathon (5 min)**: The ultimate test of stamina.
- **Sayajin (30s)**: High-stakes mode. Start with 100 points. Good hits are worth double, but bad hits hurt more.
