# 🐱 AimCat

AimCat is a simple, kid-friendly aim trainer built with Flutter and the Flame engine. Designed for both fun and skill-building, it allows players to test their accuracy by tapping good targets while avoiding distractions.

## 🎮 About

AimCat focuses on a playful for everyone, but specially kids. The goal is simple: control a cat paw to hit "good" targets (like hearts and stars) to score maximum points. This project was created as a loving homage to my children—the original "AimCats"—and serves as a primary showcase for my development portfolio.
